**Outliers**
An outlier is a data point that is __significantly__ different from other observations in a dataset, 
lying an abnormal distance from the rest of the values

 caused by 
 -measurement errors
 -data entry mistakes
 -genuine variability 
 can skew statistical results if not properly identified and handled. 

Causes of outliers:
-Data entry errors: Mistakes made when inputting data.
-Measurement errors: Faulty equipment or experimental setups.
-Natural variation: The observation is a legitimate, though rare, value from the population.
-Experimental errors: Flaws in the research design or process.
-Intentional outliers: In some cases, data can be deliberately manipulated. 

Deal with outliers:
you can remove them if they are data errors, impute them with values like the mean or median, 
cap or Winsorize them by replacing extreme values with a set threshold,
or transform the entire dataset with methods like log transformations to reduce the impact of outliers
